# Step-by-Step Photometry Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through a typical analysis session, from launching the backend to downloading your results.

## 1. Login or Register

Create an account or log in.

Account features currently available:

- Registration with password validation
- Login with stored credentials
- Password recovery by email with a 6-digit recovery code
- Per-user saved configuration

## 2. Upload a FITS File

In the main area, use the file uploader to select your FITS image. Supported extensions: `.fits`, `.fit`, `.fts`, `.fits.gz`, `.fts.gz`.

Uploading the file only stages it in the interface. The FITS file is loaded and
checked only after you click the Start Analysis button.

## 3. Configure Observatory

In the sidebar, set your observatory details:

- **Name**: e.g., "Backyard Observatory"
- **Latitude, Longitude, Elevation**: Decimal degrees/meters. These may be auto-filled from the FITS header, but always verify.

## 4. Set Analysis Parameters

In the sidebar, adjust:

- **Estimated Seeing (FWHM)**: Initial guess in arcseconds
- **Detection Threshold**: Sigma threshold for source detection
- **FWHM Radius Factor**: Multiplier for the user-defined aperture radius (0.5 – 2.0). Values 1.1 and 1.3 are reserved for the two fixed apertures and cannot be selected without a warning.
- **Border Mask**: Pixels to exclude at the image edge
- **Calibration Filter Band**: Choose the photometric band for calibration (e.g. g, r, i)
- **Astrometry Check**: Enable to force plate solving/WCS refinement

*Cosmic ray removal is always performed automatically using the L.A.Cosmic algorithm (astroscrappy).*

## 5. (Optional) Astro-Colibri API Key

Enter your Astro-Colibri API key in the sidebar to enable real-time transient alerts and variable source cross-matching.

## 6. (Optional) Transient Candidates

Expand the "Transient Candidates" section in the sidebar:

- **Enable Transient Finder**: Activates transient detection using image subtraction against reference surveys (PanSTARRS1 for north, SkyMapper for south).
- **Reference Filter**: Select the filter band for template comparison.

## 7. Run the Analysis

Click **Start Analysis Pipeline** to begin processing. At that point the app loads
the FITS file, checks the header and WCS, and then runs the pipeline.

The following steps are performed:

1. **Background & Noise Estimation**
2. **Source Detection & Cosmic Ray Removal**
3. **Photometry**: Multi-aperture (up to 3 apertures) and PSF photometry, S/N and error calculation, quality flag assignment
4. **Astrometric Refinement** (if enabled)
5. **Photometric Calibration**: Cross-match with catalogs for zero-point
6. **Multi-Catalog Cross-Matching**: GAIA DR3, SIMBAD, SkyBoT, AAVSO VSX, Milliquas, 10 Parsec, Astro-Colibri
7. **Transient Detection** (if enabled)

If **Astrometry Check** is enabled, the app forces a new plate-solving attempt
even when a valid WCS is already present. If that forced solve fails, the app
tries to restore and continue with the original WCS when possible.

## 8. Download and Interpret Results

After processing, download the ZIP archive containing:

- `*_catalog.csv` / `.vot`: Source catalog with photometry, errors, flags, and cross-matches. Each aperture produces its own set of columns: `aperture_mag_X_X`, `aperture_mag_err_X_X`, `snr_X_X`, `quality_flag_X_X` (fixed apertures: `_1_1`, `_1_3`; user-defined aperture: e.g. `_1_5` for FWHM Radius Factor = 1.5). The catalog also keeps the legacy names and adds filter-prefixed aliases derived from the selected calibration band, for example `rapasg_psf_mag` or `rapasg_aperture_mag_1_5`.
- `*_background.fits`: 2D background and RMS maps
- `*_psf.fits`: Empirical PSF model
- `*_wcs_header.txt`: Astrometric solution header
- `*_wcs.fits`: Original image with refined WCS header (when astrometry is performed)
- `*.log`: Processing log
- `*.png`: Diagnostic plots

**Note on WCS-Solved FITS Files**: When astrometry is performed, the pipeline saves your original image with the updated WCS solution in two locations:

1. **In the ZIP archive** (`*_wcs.fits`) - included with your download
2. **In `rpp_data/fits/`** - a permanent copy that gets overwritten if you reprocess the same file

**Analysis Tracking**: All analysis results are automatically tracked in the database:

- Each WCS-solved FITS file is recorded with your username
- Each ZIP archive is linked to its source FITS file(s)
- You can have multiple analysis runs from the same FITS file (different parameters)
- Query your analysis history programmatically using `src/db_tracking.py` functions

### Photometric Quality Flags

| Quality Flag | S/N Range   | Reliability | Recommended Use  |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| `good`       | S/N ≥ 5     | High        | Science-ready    |
| `marginal`   | 3 ≤ S/N < 5 | Moderate    | Use with caution |
| `poor`       | S/N < 3     | Low         | Exclude          |

Magnitude errors are propagated as:

- **Instrumental error**: σ_mag = 1.0857 × (σ_flux / flux)
- **Calibrated error**: σ_mag_calib = √(σ_mag_inst² + σ_zp²)

**Interactive Analysis**: Use the embedded Aladin Lite viewer for real-time exploration, or export coordinates to ESA SkyView.

### External Services and Partial Results

Some cross-match steps depend on external services such as GAIA, SIMBAD,
SkyBoT, and Astro-Colibri. Network errors, timeouts, or empty catalog results do
not necessarily stop the full analysis. In many cases the pipeline continues with
partial results and records warnings in the log.

If you encounter issues, check the log file. For bugs or feedback, contact `rpp_support@saf-astronomie.fr`.

## Recent changes (version 1.7.3)

- **Pre-final release**: Internal consolidation in preparation for the stable release.
- **Photometry catalog aliases**: calibrated magnitude columns in exported catalogs now also include filter-prefixed aliases based on the selected calibration band while keeping the previous column names for compatibility.

### Version 1.7.2

- **Sexagesimal coordinates**: the Statistics section now displays target RA and DEC in both decimal degrees and sexagesimal format (HH:MM:SS / ±DD:MM:SS). The same dual format is recorded in the log.
- **Magnitude error plot**: the Y-axis of the "Magnitude Error vs Magnitude" scatter panel uses a logarithmic scale, making it easier to read photometric precision across the full magnitude range.
