# RAPAS Photometry Pipeline ‚Äî Quick Start Tutorial

This short guide shows the minimal steps to run photometry with the RAPAS app. For full details, consult the project's README.md.

1. Launch the app:
   - streamlit run pages/app.py
   - Open the provided localhost URL in your browser.

2. Login:
   - Use the login page. If browser autocomplete fails, type credentials manually.

3. Configure observatory:
   - Open the sidebar "üî≠ Observatory Data".
   - Enter Name, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation.
   - In any case the application will try to read the fits file to automatically fill the fields.

4. Upload a FITS file:
   - Use the "Choose a FITS file for analysis" uploader on the main page.
   - Supported extensions: .fits, .fit, .fts, .fits.gz

5. Main Analysis Parameters:
   - Seeing (FWHM): initial guess in arcseconds. Typical values: 2.5‚Äì3.5". The app will refine this automatically.
   - Detection Threshold (sigma): default 3.0. Increase (4‚Äì5) to reduce spurious detections in noisy images.
   - Border Mask Size (pixels): excludes image edges from detection (default ~10). Increase for vignetting or cosmetic edges.
   - Calibration Filter Band: choose the GAIA band used for zero-point (e.g., phot_g_mean_mag).
   - Max Calibration Mag: faintest magnitude to use for calibration stars (default ~20.0). Use a brighter limit (e.g., 18) for shallow or crowded fields.
   - Refine Astrometry: toggle to attempt WCS refinement (requires astrometry.net / SCAMP); enable for better catalog cross-matching.
   - Remove Cosmic Rays: enable for long exposures; set camera gain/read-noise parameters in the sidebar when enabled.
   - Force Plate Solve: force re-solving of astrometry even if WCS exists (useful when header WCS is unreliable).
   - Pixel Scale & FWHM (derived): the app computes pixel scale from header (or solved WCS) and converts seeing to pixels for detection.

5.5 Optional preprocessing:
   - In the sidebar "‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Parameters" enable options such as "Remove Cosmic Rays" or "Refine Astrometry".
   - When "Remove Cosmic Rays" is enabled, set:
     - CRR Gain (e-/ADU)
     - CRR Read Noise (e-)
     - CRR Sigma Clip (detection threshold)
   - When "Refine Astrometry" is enabled, ensure astrometry.net / SCAMP are available on the system.

6. Run photometry:
   - Click "Photometric Calibration" to start detection, cross-match and zero-point computation.
   - Wait for status messages and check the log in the output directory.

7. Inspect results:
   - View image, statistics, and the generated photometry catalog in the main page.
   - Use the "üì¶ Download Results (ZIP)" button or the archived results browser in the sidebar.

8. Troubleshooting & details:
   - See README.md in the project root for installation, dependencies, and troubleshooting tips.

If anything is unclear, open the README or check the log files saved to your output directory.
