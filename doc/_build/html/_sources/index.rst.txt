   RAPAS Photometry Pipeline
   ==========================

   Simple, minimal documentation to get started with the RAPAS Photometry Pipeline.

   This project provides a small toolkit and web front-end for running a photometry
   pipeline. The documentation here is intentionally short and focused on a quick
   start and a tiny example so you can try the project locally.
